# FakeNesicaService
Configurable mock local NESiCA-compatible service for testing/debugging purposes.

__ver 20230607__

Updated for .NET6, this was desired because of some new NamedPipes functionality was introduced in .NET5, this allows us to abolish requirements to run the service as Administrator, your normal user is sufficient.


**ver 2022**

Used for locally testing NESiCA-compatible games, when you do not want to rollout full local client + remote server setup.
If you want to do pipe-level debugging - I would recommend using IO Ninja tools suite.

This one was created for Starwing Paradox, but should work with almost any game.
