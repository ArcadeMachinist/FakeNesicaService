# FakeNesicaService
Configurable mock local NESiCA service for testing/debugging purposes.

Used for locally testing NESiCA-compatible games, when you do not want to rollout full local client + remote server setup.
If you want to do pipe-level debugging - I would recommend using IO Ninja tools suite.

This one was created for Starwing Paradox, but should work with almost any game.
